### UNNC (University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China) Library Simulation in 2019 

This project can be run on the simulation platform named AnyLogic.  
  
The aim of this project is to simulate the evacuation of the students studying at the library.  
The related statistic data are also included inside the project itself.
The interim research report has been put into the project zip file.  
  
This project is memorable because after one year, i.e., in 2020 summer, this library is forever closed, 
and the building may be further used for other purposes.  
A brand-new larger library will soon be established for students in UNNC to study in (Already established in September, 2020).  
  
Relevant construction information about this library may be found in this project :)
