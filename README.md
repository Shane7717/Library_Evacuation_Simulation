# UNNC Library Simulation in 2019  

This project is finished by Xixuan Wang, supervised by Chris Roadknight during summer research time, 2019.  
This project is finished on the platform named AnyLogic.  
  
The aim of this project is to simulate the evacuation of the students studying in the library.  
The related statistic data are also included inside the project itself.
The interim research report has been put into the project zip file.  
  
This project is memorable and meaningful because after one year, i.e. in 2020 summer, this library is forever closed, 
and could be further used for other purposes.  
A new larger library will soon be established for students in UNNC to study in.  
  
Therefore, relevant construction information about this library may only be found in my project :)  
More importantly, it's about one generation's memories.
